The Climate Heroes

-Problem Statement
In Africa , children are facing extreme weather events and are increasingly anxious about climate change and currently nothing is being done to educate them, 16% of students receiving climate education means 19 gigaton of CO2.

The average national climate change literacy rate in Africa is 37% -far lower than in Europe and North America, where rates are generally over 80%.

-Solution Statement
We provide an interactive VR solution to educate and empower young people to take climate actions.

A focus on climate change literacy, especially through education presents an important opportunity to put climate change on national and subnational development agendas. Increased climate change literacy, together with indigenous and local knowledge practices, can lead to more informed climate change and adaptation across Africa.
